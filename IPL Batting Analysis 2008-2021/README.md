## Objective
My objective for this Project was to unearth various useful insights from the available data that would help teams owners / people playing fantacy games get information about players that are leading in various batting stats like :
- Players with max Strike Rate.
- Players with least balls/boundary.
- Players with most runs per season and many more.<br>

Around 35 of such criterions are used to visualize the data which will give almost all the key attributes of batting.<br>
I have used matplotlib and Seaborn for carrying out the visualizations.<br>
Tech stack used: Python,numpy,pandas,matplotlib,Seaborn,html,css
