## Objective:
* My objective for this Project was to visualize the available data to draw insights from it which are not perceived just by reading through an excel/csv file.
<li> Here I have visualized the number of deaths using various plots to gain various insights from the data.</li>
<li> From this I can easily state the regions with maximum,mean deaths,year in which max deaths occured and many more.</li>
<li> I have used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data.</li>
<li> tech stack used: python,numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,html,css.</li>
