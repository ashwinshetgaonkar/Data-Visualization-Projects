## Context:
Competition in the retail industry is rising day by day. In a marketplace thatâ€™s becoming increasingly digital, retailers are compelled to use advanced analytics to ensure their business survives the competition. Before using analytics to evaluate store performance, 
it is necessary to identify the objectives behind adopting it. This ensures that the derived intelligence is effectively acted upon. 
Here are the three major reasons why businesses should consider using in-store analytics:
1. Make better Pricing Decisions
2. Get details data about Sales and Profits
3. Understand Customer behaviour


## Data:

## Objective:
* My objective for this Project was to translate the Data into a visual context so that if I was the owner of the Store I will be able to easily
understanding the Market demands and Customer behaviour which will intern help me in making decision like:
1. How much discounts to offer and for what products.
2. When to offer and in which regions to offer.
3. Make customized policies for customers of various segments and many more.
